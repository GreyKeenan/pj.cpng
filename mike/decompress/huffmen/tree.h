	data: ptr to an amt of memory which will fit the tree
	cap: length of data's memory in bytes
	maxLeaves: the maximum number of leaves the tree can support / how many codes there will be if its a properly constructed huffman tree

	calculates
		maxNodes
		childBitLength
		nodeBytes
	validates that tree will fit within cap

	initializes the ROOT of the tree as NULL so is ready to birthNode/growLeaf

	returns 0 on success
		see definition for validation failure return values

	TODO
		a little weird because, in order to create the memory, you need maxNodes & nodeBytes values anyways.
		makes sense for the specific use case here, but in theory a measure(maxLeaves) function (or just allocating memory for within the struct) would probably be more effective
