Hey guys, welcome back to my README.
Today, I'm decoding a PNG in C.
I'll probably end up displaying it SDL2 or something like that.

This stuff started in my "pj.sublime.c" repository, but I thought I'd split it out for organization and so I can focus on it properly.
I'm going to use this code in pj.sublime.c probably, but for now I'm not planning to format this like a proper library.

Thanks for checking out my README. Don't forget to like and subscribe!
